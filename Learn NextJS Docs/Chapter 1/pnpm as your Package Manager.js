/*
We recommend using pnpm as your package manager, as it is faster and more efficient than npm or yarn. If you don't have "pnpm" installed, you can install it globally by running:

-> npm install -g pnpm

More info about pnpm, go to this website "https://pnpm.io/"

To create a Next.js app, open your terminal, "cd" into the folder you'd like to keep your project and run the following command:

-> npx create-next-app@latest nextjs-dashboard --example "https://github.com/vercel/next-learn/tree/main/dashboard/starter-example" --use-pnpm

This cmd uses "create-next-app", a CLI (Command Line Interface) tool that sets up a Next.js application for you.
