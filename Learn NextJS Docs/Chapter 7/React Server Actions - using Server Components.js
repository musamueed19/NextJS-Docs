Choosing how to fetch data
API layer
APIs are an intermediary layer between your application code and database. There are a few cases where you might use an API:

If you're using 3rd party services that provide an API.
If you're fetching data from the client, you want to have an API layer that runs on the server to avoid exposing your database secrets to the client.
In Next.js, you can create API endpoints using Route Handlers.

Database queries
When you're creating a full-stack application, you'll also need to write logic to interact with your database. For relational databases like Postgres, you can do this with SQL or with an ORM.

There are a few cases where you have to write database queries:

When creating your API endpoints, you need to write logic to interact with your database.
If you are using React Server Components (fetching data on the server), you can skip the API layer, and query your database directly without risking exposing your database secrets to the client.

Let's learn more about React Server Components.

Using Server Components to fetch data
By default, Next.js applications use React Server Components. Fetching data with Server Components is a relatively new approach and there are a few benefits of using them:

Server Components support promises, providing a simpler solution for asynchronous tasks like data fetching. You can use async/await syntax without reaching out for useEffect, useState or data fetching libraries.
Server Components execute on the server, so you can keep expensive data fetches and logic on the server and only send the result to the client.
As mentioned before, since Server Components execute on the server, you can query the database directly without an additional API layer.

In libs folder:
You can call sql inside any Server Component. But to allow you to navigate the components more easily, we've kept all the data queries in the data.ts file, and you can import them into the components.
